    <h1>Clarity PPM Skillset</h1>
    <h2>Administration</h2>
    <p>I have been with the Clarity PPM tool for over 10 years and know the administration for both classic and modern user experience. I have done fresh starts for existing clients as well stood up brand new instances for new clients.</p>
    <h2>Gelscripting</h2>
    <p>I am considered a senior technical architect at regoconsulting. Gelscripting is a common place I excel at. Any script or need to have the PPM tool do an action or process is available due to my ability to script with gel script in Clarity PPM.</p>
